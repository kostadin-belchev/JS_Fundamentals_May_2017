The JavaScript Fundamentals course builds basic programming skills with JavaScript. Studying JavaScript constructs for building programming logic, data types, operators, expressions, conditional constructions, cycles, and function handling. Attention is drawn to work with arrays, strings and regular expressions, use of objects, associative arrays and sets. The course is based on state-of-the-art standards and JS technologies (ES2017 is being studied).

The course is highly practice oriented, with a huge number of class exercises and a practical exam. All tasks in the exercises and exams are automatically evaluated with the online judging system.

Participants have the opportunity to take part in a separate JavaScript Single Page Application course that covers all of the training material.

The course ends with a practical JavaScript programming exam with automated assessment with an online judging system.The course is not suitable for beginners. Initial programming skills (data handling, checks, iterations) are required, regardless of the programming language and at least basic knowledge of the HTML language.
